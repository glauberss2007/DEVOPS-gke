## Continuos integration pipeline
It makes it easy to deploy, update, and manage your applications and services, which streamlines development and iteration. Configure GKE, Cloud Source Repositories, Cloud Build, and Spinnaker services for Google Cloud to automatically build, test, and deploy an application. When application code is modified, such changes trigger the continuous delivery pipeline to automatically rebuild, retest, and redeploy a new version.
